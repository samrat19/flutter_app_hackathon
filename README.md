# plan 1: (can be done)

after the login page , there may be a page where we have two logos and two material buttons. in this format

                                                     logo (flatter)  
                                                text (intro to flutter)   
                                                     
                                                      logo (dart)
                                                text (let's introduce to dart first)
# status : Done 
                                                
* it will be better if we can use two matrial buttons and both have a child where we put the logos and texts
